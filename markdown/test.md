### Introduction: ###

We implemented serial and parallel versions of the Sequitur compression algorithm. The Sequitur algorithm uses hierarchical structure and sequences of discrete symbols to compress files by exploiting repetative structures found in strings.

Our final project is based on the algorithm as described in the following paper: "Identifying Hierarchical Structure in Sequences: A linear-time algorithm", Craig G. Nevill-Manning, Ian H. Witten, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research 7 (1997) 67.82
